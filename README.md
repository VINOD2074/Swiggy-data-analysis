Swiggy data analysis Using Microsoft Excel

This project focuses on analyzing #Swiggy’s food delivery dataset to uncover key business insights and develop an interactive dashboard for data-driven decision-making. The analysis covers sales performance, customer satisfaction metrics, order trends, and product-level insights.

Using raw data, the project highlights essential KPIs such as Total Sales, Average Rating, Rating Count, Total Orders, and Average Order Value (AOV). Monthly revenue patterns were explored to identify seasonal impacts, while dish-wise metrics helped understand consumer preferences and performance variations.

A structured agenda and detailed report were created to present findings clearly and professionally. Insights from the dashboard help stakeholders improve pricing strategy, enhance customer experience, and identify opportunities for operational and marketing optimization.

Overall, this project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, KPI analysis, dashboard creation, and business insight generation, making it a valuable real-world analytics case study.
